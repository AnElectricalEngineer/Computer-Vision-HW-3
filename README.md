# Segmentation

Segmentation is a miniproject in Computer Vision which compares and analyzes the performance of several classic and deep segmentation methods.
 
## About Segmentation

Segmentation is a two part work. 

In the first part, a classic segmentation method (GrabCut) is first used to segment several simple images. Then, a deep-learning based method (DeepLabV3 RESNET 101) is used to segment the same images. The process is then repeated on a new batch of more complex images. The results of the segmentations of each method are then compared and analyzed, and suggestions to improve segmentation performance are offered. Finally, deep segmentation is used to create an image of an animal (a lion) with an unnatural background (under the sea), and the performance of a pre-trained image classification network (VGG16) on this image is evaluated and analyzed.

In the second part, deep segmentation is applied to a video, and is used to create a new video which consists of several dynamic, segmented objects.
